## Contributing
First off, thank you for considering contributing to InterCamp. It's people like you that make InterCamp such a great app.

### Where do I go from here?
If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

Label the issue with [bug], [good first issue], [feature] ect.

### Pull Requests

Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
Ensure the test suite passes.
Make sure your code lints.

### Fork & create a branch
If this is something you think you can fix, then fork [Inter-Camp](https://github.com/Inter-Camp/InterCamp) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

### A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

`` git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations ``

### Code Quality
Code should be properly formatted (following existing formatting). 
It uses [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

Inline code documentation. Code should be self-expressive

Prefer smaller, focussed changes. For example, separate renaming/refactoring changes from new features or bug fixes.

### Testing
Write unit tests to cover code changes you make. We aim for 100% code coverage
Make sure no existing test is broken
